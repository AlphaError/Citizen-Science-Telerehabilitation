# VR Interface for Citizen Science-Base Telerehabilitation
## Purpose
The overall purpose of this project has been the creation a better option for stroke patients in their at-home rehabilitation. Virtual reality and citizen science provide a combination of immersion and purpose that engage the patient in their rehabilitation while the remote nature of the interface provides accessibility and longevity.
The initial vision was for patients to feel motivated in completing their own rehabilitation without needing a healthcare provider -- using the direction of the interface to assist them through it.
While this ideal is still preserved, patients now can optionally benefit from the direction of a healthcare provider via the difficulty meter and tracking of patient's data.

## Full Project Abstract
Stroke survivors commonly suffer from hemiparesis- unilateral muscle weakness that limits limb mobility and encumbers the performance of daily activities. Recovery from hemiparesis requires adherence to a rehabilitation regimen, consisting of high-intensity exercises. While these exercises are often perceived as tedious and boring, the integration of citizen science can motivate patients to adhere to their prescribed regimen. Furthermore, by interfacing rehabilitation with a commercial gaming controller, patients can receive remote feedback from therapists, significantly reducing the temporal and fiscal costs associated with outpatient rehabilitation. In this project, we develop a platform to enable hemiparetic patients to participate in a citizen science project while performing bimanual training within an immersive VR environment. The Oculus Quest and Touch controllers’ built-in accelerometer and gyroscope sensors gather data on the patients’ movement all while providing the user with haptic feedback. These data are then used to intuitively control the cursor and menu within the interface. While the game’s difficulty is calibrated relative to the patient’s physical ability and motivation, the patient and therapist can manually adjust the difficulty of the game as they see fit. This affordable platform could benefit not only stroke patients but also the scientific community through the recruitment of citizen-scientists.
## For Future Editors of this Project
Before accessing this project, it was implemented for the Novint Falcon and subsequently the Xbox Kinect. Much of the code from these previous two iterations were preserved throughout the commits however some of the basic functionality was rewritten due to incompatibility with the Nintendo switch/keyboard controls.
### Future Changes
Enabling local and online multiplated functionality, creating a social media-like structure where progression/achievements can be shared amonst patients, Adding more secure accounts with passwords
### Coding Specifications
Assets/Scenes/PanoScene/Scripts for the bulk of user-created/running code,
Assets/_DS_Store for visual changes,
Assets/UserData for data storage, 
Builds/ for runnable game (without Unity editor)
The main document for the game code is called MakeWordBank (the rest is named correctly)

## Other Notes
The default game controller we were planning on initially using was the Nintendo Switch Joycons and RingFit accessory, however, the RingFit was sold out, and, after much effort, Nintendo was unable to give us access to their Switch API - as such we are currently transitioning to a separate device.
In the interim, the project's controls were changed to the keyboard to make navigation during beta-testing easy and migration to another device more smooth. Transition into VR, specifically the Oculus Quest, are in progress.
### Project Specifications
